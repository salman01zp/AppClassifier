# App Classifier
There are 41 categories in google play store to categorize your app and more than one million apps , which create huge problem for developer to categorize their app into rigth category. Due to this miss categorization of app, it makes difficult for user to find app and thus decreasing the number of downloads and reduction in earnings. 
To over come this problem we propose a Machine Learning based program AppClassifier to classify all the apps into thier right categories and thus makes it easy to find and increases profit by increase in number of downloads  <b />

AppClassifier uses [NaiveBayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) Classifier to classify the app into their respective Category
